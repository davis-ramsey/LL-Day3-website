    <h1>What's Your Why?</h1>
    <h2>Why I Joined Lambda</h2>
    <h3>And What I Hope to Achieve</h3>
    <section class="text" id="p1">
        <p>It's likely not a stretch to say that everyone in Lambda came from a unique set of circumstances. I was somewhat lucky to discover what would become my lifelong passion
         early on in college, and I spent every waking second making it become a reality. I've been trading capital markets from stocks to bitcoin for the last seven years but to say
         I have the same passion for trading I did seven years ago would be a lie. My dedication to learning something I love knows virtually no end. I spent a very long time
         learning everything there is to know about markets. One cannot know everything about any subject, especially markets, but I've come to believe there is an even more 
         exciting world out there ready for me to explore.

        <p>I first heard about Lambda from someone retweeting Austen a couple years ago. I thought little else about it until very recently when my wife and I welcomed our first
            child into the world. One big disadvantage you can probably imagine about trading on your own as your sole income is that making money is not guaranteed. Making money
            tomorrow is not guaranteed. Making money a year from now is not guaranteed. A funny side effect of that is you don't actually qualify for a mortgage, especially if you
            deal heavily in cryptocurrency. As a young single guy with no responsibility, unrealiable income can be managed. With a wife, child, and hopefully more children to come,
            you need stability. Not necessarily a paycheck but the confidence that you can create clear value doing something you're passionate about.

    <section class="text" id="p3">
        <p>There is a growing movement in crypto, specifically on Ethereum called decentralized finance. It basically wants to reshape the financial system to empower people,
            not giant banks and corporations. My dream is to one day contribute meaningfully towards this movement and joining Lambda is my first step towards making that a reality.
            Realistically I have a long way to go, and the road will undoubtedly be harder than I know at this point. I have perhaps the strongest motivation possible - to provide
            a good life for my wife and son. I think I can say I've discovered my third great passion in life is to learn programming and build things. The second is being a Dad.
